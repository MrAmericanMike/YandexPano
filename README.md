You need to provide your own Yandex API Key in the call to the API in index.html on line 8 where it says `<KEY-HERE>`

This example just contains 5 hardcoded locations to simulate a 5 rounds game.

Moving around does not increases API usage, only using the createPlayer and moveTo count towards API usage. So a game of 5 rounds results in 25 "calls".
